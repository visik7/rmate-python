# rmate

The `rmate` program enables editing files on a remote computer with TextMate 2 via an SSH connection. This Python implementation has been tested with versions 2.4-3.4.

## Setting up `rmate`

### Getting the program

To use `rmate`, cut & paste this onliner

	mkdir ~/bin ; curl  -Lo ~/bin/rmate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sclukey/rmate-python/master/rmate && chmod +x ~/bin/rmate && echo "export PATH="\$PATH:\$HOME/bin"" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

The make the script accessible from anywhere, simply move it to a location within your `PATH` environment variable

	mv ./rmate /usr/local/bin/rmate

### Setting up the connection

For the program to be able to connect back to TextMate a port must be tunneled in the ssh connection. This can be done by just adding an option to tunnel the port in the SSH connection command

	ssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@example.com

or by adding a rule to your `~/.ssh/config`

	Host *
	RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698

	usage: rmate [OPTION]... FILE...
